Near-threshold computing (NTC) has been suggested as a way to continue Moore's
law scaling by offering a 10x improvement in energy
efficiency~\cite{dreslinski2010near}. With this energy improvement however
comes a range of problems including a 10x increase in delay (reduction in
performance), 5x increase in global process variation, and 5 orders of magnitude
increase in failure rate. In this paper, we reexamine several techniques
proposed for mitigating these issues, including device optimizations, soft-edge
clocking, body biasing, and cluster-based architectures, and address why they
may be less effective than stated at dealing with the issues of NTC. We also
examine the additional issue of DC-DC converter efficiency in NTC, and further
show how the lack of application-level parallelism will provide limited
opportunities for regaining performance.
