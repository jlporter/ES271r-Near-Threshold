\section{Voltage Regulators}

As shown in [A], compared to operating a digital design at the nominal voltage,
operating a design at a supply voltage level that is near the device threshold
voltage provides more energy-efficient computations. However, to fairly evaluate
the energy saving obtainable from the near-threshold computing approach, the
overhead in generating a near-threshold supply needs to be evaluated. Both [B]
and [C] raised the concern that the efficiency of the voltage regulator would be
lower for delivering power to a near-threshold computing design. [B] presents
evidence that typical voltage regulator efficiency is lower at light load and
argues that if a near threshold design consumes less power the efficiency will
be lower.  [C] considers the case where the chip supply voltage is generated
with an on-chip switch-capacitor converter. They shows that the efficiency of
the regulator is at 90\% for an output voltage of 1.2V and is at 70\% for an
output voltage of 0.5V.

In the context of server computing, the power is delivered to the
microprocessors is typically through a buck converter which down convert the 12V
mother board voltage [].Although it is difficult to derive a quantitative
comparison between the efficiency of a 1.2V output for an above threshold design
and a 0.5 output for a near threshold design, it is possible to consider the
difference in requirement for these two regulators and understand where the
difference in efficiency may come in. It is intuitive to compare the above
threshold converter and the near threshold converter at the same percentage of
voltage ripple requirement. However, as shown in equation X3, the delay of a
logic gate is more sensitive to the supply voltage in the near threshold region.
Thus, if voltage ripple requirement is the same, the near threshold DC-DC
converter will introduce more delay variation in the design. As performance
variation has already been one of the key limiting factors for near threshold
computing, it is desirable to maintain the same variation level due to voltage
ripple. Thus, it is necessary to have a stringent voltage ripple requirement for
a near-threshold voltage regulator. 

In addition, the current consumption of the two regulators will also be
different. One of the goals of employing near threshold computing for servers is
to reduce power consumption while maintaining throughput. However, unless near
threshold computing can achieve power reduction by a factor that is larger than
the supply voltage ratio, the current drawn by a near threshold design is going
to be higher. This higher output current is particular problematic for the power
loss due to the output rectification. The efficiency loss in the output
rectification is the ratio between the output voltage and the voltage drop
across the output transistor. Since the output voltage is small, the regulator
is more sensitive to voltage drop across the output transistor. On top of that,
the higher output current further increases the voltage drop across the output
stage.
